  const message = `‚ÄúTHE BONUS MOM I DIDN‚ÄôT KNOW I NEEDED‚Äù
YOU STEPPED IN SOFT, NO NEED FOR PRAISE
BUT LEFT YOUR MARK IN SUBTLE WAYS.
A SECOND HEART, A SECOND HOME,
WHERE I FELT SAFE, WHERE I HAD GROWN.

YOU DIDN‚ÄôT HAVE TO CARE LIKE THIS,
OR TEACH ME THROUGH EACH HUG AND KISS
BUT YOU DID. AND THAT‚ÄôS THE THING:
YOU GAVE ME LOVE WITHOUT A STRING.

SO TODAY I HONOR WHAT YOU‚ÄôVE DONE,
NOT JUST AN AUNT‚ÄîA CHOSEN ONE.
MOTHER BY SPIRIT, FRIEND BY ROLE,
AUNTIE YOU‚ÄôVE GOT A HEART WORTH MORE THAN GOLD.

---

THIS HAS BEEN A ROUGH JOURNEY TRYING TO GET THIS WHOLE IDEA RIGHT.
THE DAYS WHEN IT GETS OVERWHELMING, I THINK BACK TO 5TH GRADE
WHEN I LEARNED POWERPOINT.
I CAME HOME AND PUT TOGETHER A BUNCH OF SLIDES TO ANY ADULT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOOLISHNESS
(IF I WERE TO LOOK BACK AT IT NOW).
BUT YOU DIDN‚ÄôT SEE IT LIKE THAT.
YOU WATCHED THE WHOLE THING AND TOLD ME TO KEEP PRACTICING
THAT ONE DAY, I‚ÄôD DO BIG THINGS ON THE COMPUTER.

THAT‚ÄôS A KEY MEMORY.
AND I DON‚ÄôT SAY THIS LIGHTLY WHEN I TELL YOU
THAT MEMORY KEEPS ME GOING ON THE DAYS I FEEL LIKE GIVING UP.

THANKS FOR ALWAYS SUPPORTING ME
AND HEARING ME OUT WHEN IT SEEMED LIKE NO ONE ELSE WANTED TO.

I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU‚ÄôLL EVER UNDERSTAND.
BLESSED BEYOND BELIEF TO HAVE YOU IN MY LIFE.

THANK YOU, AUNTIE.
HAPPY MOTHER‚ÄôS DAY 2025 LOVE YOUR GOD SONE GJ.`;
